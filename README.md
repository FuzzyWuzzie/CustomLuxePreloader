# CustomLuxePreloader

A simple demo showing how you can "write your own" preloader to replace the simple bar that ships with Luxe. This demo shows a digital circle progress bar with the loading progress as text in the middle. Very bare-bones.

>PLEASE NOTE! This demo was created using an ALPHA version of [Luxe](http://luxeengine.com/). As such, it may very well be obsolete by the time you look at it. It is current and working as of `alpha-2.0`, however the API can and likely will change without any hesitation! You've been warned!
